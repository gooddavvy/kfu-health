> Soon, this project will be moved to [github.com/gooddavvy/kfu-labs](https://github.com/gooddavvy/kfu-labs). It will be the Phase 2 of the project, and will use TailwindCSS alongside other UI tools.

# Overview

KFU Health (commonly known as KFU, which stands for _Keep Fit Up!_) is a comprehensive fitness tracker designed to help you reach your health and fitness goals. It not only monitors your progress towards these goals but also provides estimates of your overall health and fitness through visual aids like pie charts or graphs.

As you make progress, KFU rewards you with points that are added to your dashboard. Additionally, by completing special fitness and health challenges, you can earn various trophies to celebrate your achievements!

But don't forget, the complex project is still in progress; and it may never end - even if it gets moved to a new repo, or gets acquired by a software company, even if a new type of coding is invented, or if any app beats or aims to beat it, etc., it may never end (it was not built to end). Also, it uses NextJS, TypeScript, Material UI, and the Carbon Design System, as well as some fake user profile credentials for now.

# Pages

Let's explore some of the planned pages for this app.

# How to Use

First, download the latest version of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/). Then run in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gooddavvy/kfu-health.git
cd kfu-health
npm i
npm run server
```

Remember only to run `npm run server` **only once**. The next time you run the server, run `npm run dev`. Failure to do so may result in data loss.

Also, if you don't want to use `npm run server`, run this:

```bash
npm run kfu-setup
$env:PORT=4000; npm run dev # On windows
PORT=4000 npm run dev # On Unix-based systems
```

Once again, `npm run kfu-setup` should be run **only once**.

# Contributions, Stars, and More

We believe that if you give this project **one** (yes, 1) run, you will admit that despite the ongoing, in-progress, low-security, slightly-rough nature of this product, this will be one of the world's most useful fitness trackers in the entire world.

And that's one of the reasons we're looking for two major things on GitHub: **Stars and Contributions**.

1. **Stars:** If you like this app upon the single run, please go ahead and star it. Why not, after all?
2. **Contributions:** If you see several issues in the app you believe you can solve, who says you can't contribute?

Thank you very much, community, for supporting one of the largest projects I have ever developed, and possibly one of the largest projects I've ever seen on GitHub. Once again:

###### Thank you! Mahalo! Merci!
